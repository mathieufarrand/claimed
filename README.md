# Elyra Component Library - The Component Library for AI, Machine Learning, ETL, and Data Science

**TL;DR**
- set of re-usable coarse-grained components (just a bunch of code)
- think of tasks, not functions (e.g. read from database, transform data, train model, deploy model, ...)
- write once, runs everywhere (export to Kubeflow, Apache Airflow, Apache Nifi, ...)
- just use python, no other skills required (no Kubeflow component yaml, maven, Java, ...)
- 1st class citizen in JupyterLab and the Elyra Pipeline Editor (creating a low code / no code IDE for data science) 
- upstream repository to IBM Watson Studio Pipelines contributed components in IBM Cloud Pak for Data


This is a component library for artificial intelligence, machine learning,
"extract, transform, load" processes and data science.
The goal is to enable low-code/no-code rapid prototyping by providing
ready-made components for various business domains,
supporting various computer languages, working on various data flow editors and
running on diverse execution engines.
To demonstrate its utility, we constructed a workflow composed exclusively of this library's components.
To demonstrate the capabilities of this library, we made use of a publicly available Computed Tomography (CT) scans dataset [covidata]
and created a deep learning model, which is supposed to classify exams as either
COVID-19 positive or negative. The pipeline was built with Elyra's Pipeline Visual Editor,
with support for local, Airflow and Kubeflow execution [https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03281](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03281).

Components of this library can be exported as:
1. KubeFlow pipeline components
2. Apache Airflow components
3. Standalone graphical components for the Elyra pipeline editor
4. Standalone components to be run from the command line

*Visually create pipelines from notebooks and run everywhere*

Each notebook is following a similar format.

1. The first cell contains a description of the component itself.
2. The second cell installs all dependencies using pip3.
3. The third cell imports all dependencies.
4. The fourth cell contains a list of dependencies, input parameters, and return values as Python comments
5. The fifth cell reads the input parameters from environment variables.
